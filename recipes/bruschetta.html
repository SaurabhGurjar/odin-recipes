        <h2>What is Bruschetta?</h2>
        <p>
            Bruschetta (pronounced brew-SKET-tah) is an Italian appetizer or antipasti that starts with a base of toasted or grilled bread. 
            The bread is then served warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so each person can build their own bruschetta. 
            Bruschetta is meant to be served as a hand-held finger food, large enough for one or two bites.
